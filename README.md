<h2> Welcome to Fluenza_'s YML repository! </h2>
<p>Here I create YAML files for everyone who needs assistance in the coding region </p>

<h3> How do I get a YAML done from you?  </h3>
<p> Quite simple. Pull a request or contact me on Skype: <i>jozzeh.mc</i></p>

<h3 Okay, cool. How will I know if my map YAML has been completed? </h3>
<p> It is recommended you check this repo every day or two, as I work quite fast. If you are too lazy too, I'll add it to your release thread! </p>

<strong>Also, no watermarks, or contributor additions will be made.</strong>
